//! GOF-style triangle-mesh extraction from a trained 3DGS splat.
//!
//! Implements the pipeline from "Gaussian Opacity Fields: Efficient Adaptive
//! Surface Reconstruction in Unbounded Scenes" (Yu et al., SIGGRAPH Asia '24)
//! against an already-trained splat: sample tetrahedral seed points from each
//! Gaussian, build a 3D Delaunay triangulation on CPU, integrate per-point
//! opacity along training-camera rays on GPU, then run marching tets +
//! binary-search refinement against the configured iso level set.
//!
